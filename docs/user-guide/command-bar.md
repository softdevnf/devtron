# Command bar

## Why command bar?
Let’s admit, as engineers we would get rid of the mouse if we could. We would rather press a few keys rather than clicking around the screen to get something done.
The command bar allows you to do this for navigating around the devtron dashboard.

### Keys

| Action | Keys |
| :--- | :--- |
| Open Command bar | `Cmd/Ctrl + /` |
| Navigate | &#8595; &#8593;|
| Explore nested options | &#8594; |
| Navigate to a screen | `Enter` |

Top-level categories (eg. app, chart, security, global-config) are auto-filled depending upon your location in the devtron dashboard
You can clear the top-level category to navigate within other category locations.

### Steps to navigate to Workflow editor of an app (we’ll use dashboard app for this example)

1. Open command bar by clicking the search bar or pressing `/`.

2. Start typing the app name or part of the app name you’re looking for.

3. Navigate using `↓` `↑` between the matching results and press `→` to view nested options.
`Note: Pressing Enter on a highlighted option will navigate to the selected page location.`

4. Selecting options creates a path in the command bar which is used to navigate to the desired location.

5. In this case, `app / dashboard / configure / workflow-editor` will navigate is to the Workflow editor for dashboard application.

Similarly, you can use the command bar to navigate across the Devtron dashboard without a click.
