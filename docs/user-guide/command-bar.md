# Command bar

## Why command bar?
Let’s admit, as engineers we would get rid of the mouse if we could. We would rather press a few keys rather than clicking around the screen to get something done.
The command bar allows you to do this for navigating around the devtron dashboard.

### Keys

| Action | Keys |
| :--- | :--- |
| Open Command bar | <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> |
| Navigate | <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> <kbd>&#8593;</kbd>|
| Explore nested options | <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> |
| Navigate to a screen | <kbd>Enter</kbd> |

<br>
Top-level categories (eg. app, chart, security, global-config) are auto-filled depending upon your location in the devtron dashboard.

> You can clear the top-level category to navigate within other category locations.

### How to use the command bar (Eg. Navigate to Workflow editor of an App.)

1. Open command bar by clicking the search bar or pressing <kbd>/</kbd>

2. Start typing the app name you’re looking for.

3. Navigate using <kbd>↓</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd> between the matching results and press <kbd>→</kbd> to view nested options.

> Note: Pressing Enter on a highlighted option will navigate to the selected page location.

4. In this case, `app / dashboard / configure / workflow-editor` will navigate to the Workflow editor for `dashboard` application.

Similarly, you can use the command bar to navigate across the Devtron dashboard without a click.
