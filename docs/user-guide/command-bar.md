# Command bar
## Why command bar?
Let's admit, as engineers we would get rid of the mouse if we could. We would rather press a few keys than click around the screen to get something done.
The command bar allows you to do exactly this for navigating around the Devtron dashboard.

Top-level categories (eg. app, chart, security, global-config) are auto-filled depending upon your location on the Devtron dashboard.

> You can clear the top-level category to navigate within other category locations.

### How to use the command bar (Eg. Navigate to Workflow editor of an App.)

1. Open command bar by clicking the üîç search icon on left navbar or pressing <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>

2. Start typing the app name you're looking for.

3. Navigate using <kbd>‚Üì</kbd> <kbd>‚Üë</kbd> between the matching results and press <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> to view nested options.
> Note: Pressing Enter on a highlighted option will navigate to the selected page location.

4. In this case, `app / dashboard / configure / workflow-editor` will navigate to the Workflow editor for `dashboard` application.

Similarly, you can use the command bar to navigate around the Devtron dashboard without a click.
